          <h2>Understanding climate change with data</h2>
          <p>Climate change is one of the hardest pressing issues that modern society faces. From the advent of transport automation via coal, the environment that we know is slowly becoming perilous. This coupled with the fact that corporations are diminishing and ruining natural resources on our planet; there is an influx of smog, CO2 (Carbon dioxide) emissions, and so much more other harmful pollutant in the ozone of the Earth. Climate change is real and is already having a significant impact on our ecosystems, economies, and our communities.</span></p>

          <p>In a nutshell, climate change is defined by NASA as the variations in the average conditions, from temperatures to rain falls, over a long period of time. On the other hand, weather is described as the ecological conditions of a particular place, such as it’s hot or raining in Washington DC. Why studying the deviations of climate change is important, because of the simple fact that we only have one Earth, and that isn’t going to change for a while.
          </span></p>

          <p>Studying climate change will give us an understanding of why the temperatures are rising and worsened high and low extreme weather patterns to understanding why wildfires are more readily apparent then now then before. Even though the average temperatures see a rise in half a degree over the past 50 years, this massive and colossal effects on our ecosystem. We as human beings have a right to protect what gave 100 billion people (yes you read that correctly) food, warmth, and shelter. It’s upon us to act and act when it matters the most.</span></p>

          <h2>Global Warming</h2>
          <p>As we know that climate change is understanding the variations in weather patterns over a long period of time, global warming, on the other hand, is taking a look into how these temperatures are changing due to human activities. These activities include burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, dirtier air, and an increase in acidic oceans. An amalgamation of all these different processes cause greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide and methane, to be trapped in the environment and slowly deplete the ozone layer.</span></p>

          <p>Years ago, the human race didn’t have the technologies to cause global scale effects on the Earth as we do today. However, with modern technology such as cars and trucks/vessels, we’re increasing the amount of harmful pollutants in the air at a level which nature can’t combat. This, as a result, causes drastic deviations in climate change.</span></p>

          <h2>This Portfolio</h2>
          <p>With apt data gathering, analyzing, and clean visualizations, the aim of this project is to take a serious look into understanding how climate change and global warming have and currently are affecting our Earth over the past 300 years.</span></p>

          <p>To understand the brutal effects of temperatures rising to knowing what people think about climate change in the modern era, you create a time travelling machine. The main goal for you (the reader) is to prove to the world that climate change exists and explain to the people before you the effects of modern-day global warming. You do this by calling in three meteorologist scientists from different eras: Sir John, from the 1700s, Rachel, from the 1800’s, and Bill from the 1900’s. You want to showcase your findings found throughout this portfolio how temperatures rise, how countries are effect by the changes in the drastic temperature changes, and finally, telling them what holds for the future of Earth.</span></p>

          <p>Since they’re all meteorologists, they care deeply about the environment and will be with you every step of the way across the journey of the portfolio. Best of luck and have fun you four!</span></p>
